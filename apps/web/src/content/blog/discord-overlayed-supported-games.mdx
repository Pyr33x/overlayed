There are only certain games that Discord officially supports and one day I discovered <a href="https://gist.github.com/Hacksore/517455a6d195393c385168cf3136335b" target="_blank">this API</a> which you can use to get all the games. If you play games that are not on this list or you don't use Windows then it's a perfect time to give Overlayed a try since it supports almost every game!

Official list of supported games for the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/217659737-Game-Overlay-101" target="_blank">Discord game overlay</a> as of August 6th, 2024.

### Unsupported Games
These are games that discord detects but does not support natively. As mentioned before [Overlayed](/) is likely to work fine for these games.
